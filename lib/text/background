   In the beginning there was the code and nothing but the code, have no doubt.
The code begat Zeus, and with that began a MUD in Alpha. Many came to join
Zeus and, over time the Alpha MUD became Beta. Coders soon appeared and began
shaping the MUD. The MUD grew, and has continued to grow to this day. It
sometimes suffers from growing pains, but they are dealt with as soon as they
appear. The pains are gently soothed away. Change is constant, and usually
enjoyed like a comforting bath. Some changes cause indigestion, and acid
reflux. The players are here, and more are coming this way. They suffer with
the MUD and the MUD suffers with them. They are a part of one another and the
coders, and builders are their protectors, as acid reducers, and sometimes a
gentle massage to relax tensions between the parts of the MUD. A MUD in Beta.
Our MUD, us.
