                 The Insanity Mud Immortal Handbook.
                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                          General Rules.
			  --------------

- Do not use the snoop command to invade privacy, only use when
  you suspect unusual goings on, or are trying to help someone.
- Do not use the force command to force players to do things and
  get them in trouble.
- Do not set players stats.
- If a player dies, it will usually be their fault, so do not
  restore xp or eq. Even if dying from a death trap.
- Do not load eq for a player, for any reason what so ever.
- Do not get eq for players off mobs, from shops, or from in rooms and so
  forth. In other words don't help mortals get equipment.
- Do not use ban, and purge player commands for no reason.
- Do not heal mobs if a player is fighting with them.
- No not transfer aggresive mobs, unless they are easily Killed by
  the player.
- You may transfer non-aggresive mobs, but not to continuously
  help a single player.
- Immortals (Not Gods) Must never Multiplay, unless for testing
  purposes when you must get permission from a Senior God to do so.
- Being Immortal is a PRIVILEGE not a RIGHT, abusing that privilege
  will mean losing your immortal position.
- Implementors are incharge and can break these rules when ever
  they like! So there!!!
- Read the OLC Rules with the OLCRULES command.
- NEVER give your Immortal or God password to ANYONE. Anyone found
  doing so will be deleted immediatly. You have been warned.


			Leveling Mortals.
			----------------

- Immortals must NOT create mobs which allow a mortal to level
  at an abnormal speed.
- You should not create eq, (also see OlcRules) which allows
  a Mortal to level at abnormal Speed.
- You should not even break these rules for a mortal which belongs
  to you, if you want to keep a mortal then you must play that mortal
  character with NO help from your immortal.
- If you want a Test Character then Mail an Implementor or a
  Creator who will create one for you. You must NEVER try to
  create a Test character for yourself.

			     Quest Rules
			     -----------

- You should never Give a Player Quest Points for no reason what so ever.
- Do not give out Large amounts of Quest Points to help a player level
  or give them an advantage for doing nothing at all or for very little.
- The amount of Quest points must reflect the difficulty of the Quest.
- There is a Level Dependent max amount of qpoints that you may give to a
  player however you can keep giving this amount if you like to the same
  player, but you must not do this, this means that the quest you run
  must not be worth more than the amount of quest points that you can
  give at any one time.
- If you are found to be giving more quest points than you are allowed
  to a player in a short amount of time, by repeating the command, or
  if you break any of these rules then you will be demoted a level.

                                Copyright
                                ---------

- All zones you create on this mud become the property of the Implementors.

- If you want a copy of a zone you must get an Implementor to send it to
  you. You must also credit Insanity in the destination muds credits and
  in the zone. You must also include the address of Insanity Mud.

- The implementors reserve the right to alter you zone in any way or form.

- Any alterations to the zone can be done by any person the implementors
  give persmission to do so.

- If you do not agree to these terms then do NOT create zones on this mud,
  go elsewhere. This policy is not flexible.

			       Demotion
			       --------

- If you break the above rules then you will be demoted by one Immortal
  level each time you break these rules.
- If you are at the lowest Immortal Level then you character will be
  DELETED and Not demoted.

			         Syslog
				 ------

- All God Commands and Actions are Reported to the syslog, not just
  online but they are also saved to a file on disk, which will
  be looked at on a regular basis to check immortals are not abusing
  the privalige they have been given.

                            Responsabilities
                            ----------------

- Things we expect you to be on the look out for, things you can do to
  make the world run smoother for the mortals. The Implementors cannot be on
  all the time, we need you to be our eyes and ears when we are away.

- As when you were a mortal, player killing, player stealing, corpse looting,
  multiplaying and harassment are all unacceptable behaviour. As am Immortal,
  you have some responsibility to insure this does not happen.

- Mortals who walk around insulting people, emoting rape or in any other way
  behaving antisocially should be warned, and in extreme cases be removed from
  play. Remember that many troublemakers log on just to annoy others, and
  seldom stop when warned.

- If talking does not change the situation you will need to enlist the
  assistance of a Greater God, Supreme God, Creator or Implementor. They can
  act as judges in mortal affairs. Lower immortals should use what powers
  they have to solve problems, for instance transferring a troublemaker to
  a no exit room, though they should only do so in clear cases, and never
  go to extremes.

- A mortal who tries to escape justice by quitting, renting, cutting link or
  simply ignoring an immortal should be given a more severe punishment.
  Higher immortals know how to get them.


                                 Promotion.
 			         ----------

- You will NOT get promoted by asking, infact the opposite will happen,
  you will annoy the Implementors and they will just ignore you or demote
  you.
- Promotion is given for continued contribution to the game, by Zones,
  Ideas, Code, Helping players, Helping other immortals.
- There is no set amount of those things that you have to do. If you
  make your prescence know to the Implementors you are more likely to get
  promoted. However that does not include asking for promotion, see above.
- Just because someone else gets promoted doesn't mean you have to.
  Arguing about this with a Implementor will not put you in good light and
  will jeperdise chances of future promotion.
- The Implementors word is final. If they say that you don't deserve a
  promotion then accept that it is more than likely you will be promoted
  at a later time.
- Implementors reserve the right to promote people from outside the mud,
  whether or not they have played Insanity before, this may mean promotion
  above your head. Arguing with the Implementors about this will get
  you demoted.
- You are not guarenteed promotion on Insanity Mud, you may never get
  promotion, that is how life is sometimes.
- If you don't like these rules on promotion then leave, you will
  not be missed.

                             A Small Clause.
                             ---------------

  It's not possible to list all the rules and regulations in this short
  document, and from time to time senior gods and Implementors may have to
  make on the spot decsisions with regard to situations they find have
  arrisen, this may involve demotions or any other form of action they
  consider to be warrented. But I am sure that most players in immortal
  positions on this Mud have the good sence not to do anything that would
  lead then into any such danger. To summerise Implementors on this Mud can do
  anything at anytime and their decsisions are final.
