**************************************************************************
	THESE RULES ARE FIRM NAD BREAKING THEM WILL LEAD
		TO SERIOUS CONSIQUENCES (SEE HANDBOOK)
**************************************************************************

- Immortals and Builders are shown warnings via their syslog
  display. You can concider that any eq that generates such a warning
  should not be allowed into the game.

                               Modifiers
                               ---------

- No Item should affect any stat by more than 3, ie +WIS.
  This limit should when apllies to mutilple affections on one piece of 
  equipment be spread over the affections, in which case the maximum
  improvemnet then should total no more than 4 if there is matching
  negative gain.

  EG +2 WIS +2 INT -1 CON would be acceptable.

- Use your common sense with items that you make, for example, why
  should a container affect armor class and why should a weapon affect WIS
  try to only have affections that are relevent to the equipment that you
  make.

                            Class Restrictions
                            ------------------

- Equipment should follow the class restrictions layed out for each
  class in the help file. For example Clerics should not be allowed to
  use sharp weapons.

- Try to restrict powerfull equipment to certain classes, that way not
  everyone in the game gets to have it!

- Don't set all your equipment in a zone so that only one class can use
  it, its not fair and most players won't go into your zone.


                            Potions/Wands/Staffs
                            --------------------

- The maximin Charges for these Items should be no more than 5. Do not
  make any magic available to low level players that they could not have
  at their present level. This means, for example, a level 10 warrior
  should not have level 60 cleric spells availble to them by using a wand
  or staff or potion. Recall and Identify are exceptions to this rule.

- Potions that heal should have a maximun of one heal and perhaps one
  other affection, in which case they should be very expensive and made to
  have a weight of at least 6 units.

                                Containers
                                ----------

- Containers of any description should never have any other affections,
  they should never have a negative mass and should never be above 3000
  capasity.

                             Level Restrictions
                             ------------------

- When setting level restitions, you should think very carfully.
  Broadly speaking the eq that you make should be banded into
  10 level groupings, ie level 1 - 10, 10 - 20. Powerfull eq should have
  high level restrictions.

- When creating a zone you should gear the mobs and eq to one of these
  bands and set level restitions accordingly you will be asked for witch
  band your zone is intended and the eq will be expected to conform to
  sensible limits for the zone.

                                 Houses
                                 ------

- If you do need more rooms for house. Please get access from a Founder or
  Creator to use zone 58 for making new rooms and not the assigned zone 
  you are given.

- Players houses are not free, *do not* create them without taking their
  money. See the policy for the relevant costs.

                             General Stuff
                             -------------

- From time to time a Creator or Founder will look over your zone,
  just to make sure you *do not* break the OLC rules.

- If you want to create a new zone or are ready to have a new zone you
  have built linked then you must speak to Behemoth or one of the Senior
  Builders, see the credits, who will get the new zone sorted out for you.
  If you are desperate to start a new zone then ask any one of the
  Founders or a creator may be able to assign you a zone which is free.

- If you have any questions relating to these rules please address them to
  a Creator or Founder.
