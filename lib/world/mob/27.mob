Farlenian~
Farlenian~
Farlenian the soldier stands and watches quietly.
~
   Farlenian is a dark-haired, blue-eyed man with an extremely
grave expression drawn upon his face.  He wears a bright blue
set of overalls, with some protective layers of leather overtop
and a white cloak to round it out.  His crossbow looks well-used
and cared for.  You think he knows how to use it.

Alerka~
Alerka Bardbane is resting here.
~
   Alerka sneers at you rudely, and ignores you.  He looks
rather non-descript and plain, just an ordinary man taking
a break.
   His knives do not look ordinary at all, however.

perhaps?

~
   Airden is a tall, skinny human, dressed in simple clothes.  He
smiles at you and nods hello.  The dust on his clothes tells
tales of many strange lands and stranger adventures, and for
a moment you consider asking him to tell you a story.

A young woman sits here, a confused expression upon her face.

Jordo~
Jordo the Engineer is just hanging out here.
~
  Jordo's eyes glint viciously as he looks across the
room.  From the way his hands tighten on his weapon,
you can tell that he isn't quite as at ease as he
would like you to believe.

farmer~
a farmer~
A tired farmer relaxes here, for awhile.
~
   The dust and dirt of the land cover this man head to toe.  His
eyes look weary, his hands calloused, and those big workboots he's
wearing just can't be comfortable.  This man is one of the citizenry
elite; he feeds the people through his own hard work.  Maybe you
should buy him a beer.

Werith~
Werith~
Werith tends bar here, listening but not talking very much.
~
   From the size of those arms, this man must've once been a blacksmith.
You bet he can more than take on anyone who wants to knock over his
wayhouse for a little cash...this man is truly immense.  His movements
sure, his eyes keen...you don't think messing with him would be a good
idea.

the sides of the glass.
