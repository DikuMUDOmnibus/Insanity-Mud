dress wedding~
As is fitting of the person who is wearing this dress, all traditions have been
eschewed, for a more elaborate, yet understated effect. The dress is made
entirely of what you assume to be Spanish silk, spun by hand in the northern
regions. Around the edges, a simple square cut pattern has been embroidered in
thin gold thread. The simplicity of it all draws your attention to the wearer
of the dress, and how breathtakingly beautiful they look.
