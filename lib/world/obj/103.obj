The phaser has a grey body and a black encasement at the
business end of it.  There are small red lights just above the
trigger.  The lights read: power *****  beam **
To bad you are unaware of how to change the setting.  It looks
like it could be a very dangerous weapon if it were set on max power.

The Klingon Bat'leth is a multi-bladed weapon that has two handle grips
in a curved, double-sided blade.  Two smaller blades are attached inside
the outer blades.  The bat'leth is best when used less like a weapon, 
and more like an extension of the body.
