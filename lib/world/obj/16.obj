   The lightly seems to move slowly down in an almost waterfall fashion. It

The warth caress you and makes you see things in a strange new esoteric light.

Pink and shining, surely this cape has been blessed by the touch of

have woven a cloak so metallic and glittery and bright.

For an object made out of rubber, it glows incredibly brightly without
burning, similar to an eternal flame that has been barely cloaked by
a layer of fog, or a light placed in an alabaster jar, still shining
through it with an undying glow.

dress wedding~
So pure, so innocent, surely it humbles its wearer with the dark shame of 
womanhood. Ethereal, yielding, it enfolds its wear like a shining cloud, 
enfolds like water with a liquid life, pours forth radiant, warm thoughts, 
the liquid letters of speech, symbols of the element of mystery, like a
cloud of vapour or waters circumfluent in space, a portrait of the artist
when young.
~
E
pearl grape dew drops~
Ethereal, rustling with a soft liquid joy like the sound of many waters
flowing, smooth as the soft peace of silent spaces of fading tenuous sky
above the waters, of oceanic silence, of swallows flying through the sea-
dusk over the flowing waters. All of this Joycean scenery is reflected in
the purity of the pearls and drops of gentle dew, barely disturbed by a
the dark amethyst grapes, like muted notes.

Reflections of enchantment within the gold and diamond shine of the ring,
visions of the ecstasy of seraphic life... or is that just a very bad 
reflection of a fruit fly flitting about? Whatever it might reflect, the
token of affection seems ablaze with a cool white flame, deepening into
an afterglow of rose and ardent light, the heart's unfinished landscape,
a surrealistic Joycean scene.

blood circle sex magic~
   Carved into the floor, the words are written in a strange, magical language.
Strangely, after a few seconds, the words start to force their meaning into
your head. The words you read over and over again. "\c01Blood \c03Sugar,
\c02Sex \c04Magic\c00". After saying this to yourself over and over again the
circle glows and the letters begin to burn in strange colours. The smoke that
curls off the letters induces some sort of halucination, the scene that forms
before you is your hearts desire. The scene plays out before you in the way
you have always wished and desired and your consciousness is transported to a
new realm of reality.  

As the smoke clears you find yourself exhausted and lying on the
floor ... but you feel strangely happy.
