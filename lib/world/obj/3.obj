fountain~
The fountain is made from the finest stone, crafted by the finest hands in the
whole of Insanity. The water spurts out from a small lilac shaped nozzle in the
centre of the fountain. It then collects below into a small pool, looking into
the pool you see various coins laying on the bottom of it. Obviously put there
by visitors to the cottage. Maybe they think Zeus is short of money.
However looking at the rest of the house you decide that can't be the case.
