Cost~
As you way up in your mind the cost of having this creature
on your side, you come to realise that all of the extra 
assistance that it offers is actually being fuelled by you
*S*O*M*E*H*O*W*... If only you could work out how... and 
perhaps just maybe you could find an alternative source of
renewable rechargeable reliable energy...

Skin Case~
There is certainly something odd about this machine.
It seems almost to be alive... As you pull back the port
cover inside you see tiny claws receeding... Maybe, 
just maybe, this creature in the Psion will magically
enhance you fighting performance... But at what cost?

Palmtop Computer Electronic~
You are looking at a state of the art Palmtop computer
designed in conjunction with Psion and Goldfish Invisible (Ink).
This appears upon the surface to be a standard Series 5 model,
however this particular machine comes equipped with the
Goldfish swim faster chip, and a magical memory card. Therefore
you could probably store almost anything in it!

The case glistens almost as though it were skin...
