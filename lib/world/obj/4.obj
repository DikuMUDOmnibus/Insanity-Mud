note flossy suspicious scrap important~
On this sacred, albeit a bit chewed, scrap of paper, written in the green
regurgitated hay-spittle that signifies the glory of Flossy, is written:

   Ignoble cravens, who dare to call themselves Knights; yea, ignoble I
   say, bbbaaaaahhh, for he who pretends to be their proud heir apparent
   hath dared to lay hand on me, and, having had his way with me, to drag 
   me back by my sacred hairs, bbaaaaahhh, to his clan domain. It is
   Golan who has committed such an offence, and if there is any honour
   or divine reverence in you for my sacred self, launch your thousand
   goat-chariots and avenge this dishonour upon me. I call upon you, o
   my favourite Guardian, Bottom, to attack with enmity them and all
   their accursed clan.
                                      Flossy

wig greek curls white mass~
The pale white curls of this wig would softly frame a face of Graecian
Apollonian beauty like liquid words to a poem or muted, melting notes to
a song.

beard greek facial hairs white~
Not only carefully gathered, they have also been carefully trimmed and
curled, so that they would vie with even the finest work from the finest
salons. They just scream of intelligence, excessive philosophising, one-
won't-shut-up-about-questioning-the-universe personality, and the classic
Socratic kiss (quite like the Platonic one, except it covers more ground)

A notice board made of blood-red wood stands here, adourned with notices 
from clan members.  Fortunately, they seem to be written in English, unlike 
the demonic runes covering the walls of this strage clanhouse.
