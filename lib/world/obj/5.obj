Welcome to the Realm of MORDOR traveller!
I doubt if you will be lucky enough to escape my caverns with your life.
If you can find your way then you are indeed blessed by the gods, for they
as it is will not be able to hear your cries of pain in these deep caverns!
If you came by one of my boats, I suggest you hurry for they will not last.
One last warning - Don't forget the exit key, or you'll never leave!

The Goblin King.
Ruler of all Mordor
