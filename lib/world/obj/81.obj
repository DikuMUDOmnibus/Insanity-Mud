                       The Legend of Nambor.            
    In days now forgotten to any but the living God, there lived a
    valiant Man, Nambor by name, who dared enter the evil tunnels 
    in the bowels of the mountains.  From Symtoto he came, through
    paths untrodden, until after great struggle he found a shaft 
    leading down into deep darkness.  But that was the start of poor
    Nambor's trials, for he found the entrance was too high to leave
    through. Now must he roam the tunnels of the evil creatures that
    gnaw the rocks of the Underdark, till God shows him an escape 
    from the tunnels, or from this world.
    And bravely he went forth, ever climbing deeper, sword clutched 
    in hand.  And 'tis said by the elves that he saw there many a 
    marvel; rocks that turned into vile beasts when touched, and 
    unseen creatures that lurked in the shadows.  And some there are
    that say he escaped at last, but others say he never left, but
    died in the dark, broken sword still in his hand.
    And now these tunnels are full of goblins, yet still some of the
    nameless things Nambor fought remain.  Where now is one willing
    to enter and discover the ancient hero's fate? Where now is the
    hero, to save Lonoya from the goblins?
