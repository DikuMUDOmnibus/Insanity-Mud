The Western Campus Entrance~
This gateway is made of limestone, and covered in ivy.  Beyond the
entrance, the university stretches as far as the eye can see.  A sign
is neatly posted on the left pillar of the gateway.  It is made of
nicely polished brass.  Because of this, it looks rather important
(as all signs go).  The road continues east and west from your
present location.

This is the stage which overlooks the entire auditorium.  The stage is
about three to four feet off the main floor.  Drab brown curtains frame
the outside of the stage, giving it a stage-like appearance.  Huge cords
and pulleys swing overhead, obviously used for special effects for the non
magically active.  The floor is made of sturdy wooden planks.  Backstage,
you can see several props and huge objects to fill in the background of
the stage.  Looking out into the auditorium, you can see rows and rows of
seats and a milk dispenser in the back.  The walls are... Why am I doing
this?  Most people don't even read the descriptions of the rooms unless
looking for a door of some sort!  Well there is no door here.  I bet you
have brief mode on, don't you?  So you are probably missing several of
our witty jokes!  Why must we go through all this painstaking writing of
descriptions, if they aren't going to be read?  You probably aren't even
reading this!  [Editorial :)]  Well, anyways, the only exit is to the
north.

It now contains bars hanging from the ceiling and where the desk should
be, according to the layout of every other room you have seen here at
least, stands a large water bottle structure similar to the ones used
in modern day hamster and gerbil cages.  The only exit is to the west.

how to make it so that characters could only attack a creature one at a

tight fit trying to navigate the stairs though.  The fact that there is

either.

Hallway~
This hallway leads through the darkness...there seems to be some sort
of conveyer belt under your feet, and you can see glinting objects ahead,
and the way back east seems to have disappeared.  The pictures on the
walls make you feel extremely comfortable.

Abattoir~
The walls of this room are covered with rotating knives and seem to be
heavily soundproofed.  There are chutes evenly spaced along the floor
where it meets the wall, and there are several suction devices designed
to suck your mangled flesh away.... Wait a minute.... this must be a
Death Trap... And so it is!  But, the system seems to work well, as the
rotating knives cut you up into tiny little pieces of flesh and your
blood drains down the chutes, and the suction devices casually suck
what's left of your mangled flesh away....
